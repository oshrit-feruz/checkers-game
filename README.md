**CHECKERS GAME**

# About
This game was developed after two weeks of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the course entrance exam. JavaScript.

were given three days to complete the game. we entered 40 students, we were given three days to build the game from start to finish.
In ording to understand states and object management more deeply, I chose to build the board and players using a Class that controls all game actions and scoring.
code I submitted the game.
